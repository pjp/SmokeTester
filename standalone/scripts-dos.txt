# The format of this file is :-
#
#    Lines starting with a '#' may be a comment, or a line to be evaluated as
#    either a environment value value to be set (st.value) or whitespace
#    followed by a command line to execute (to end of line)
#
#     Do note that the tag descriptors are case insensitive in regard to matching
#     against the environment tag

# Specific environment values if matching the environment passed on the command line
#
#=DEV=Hello from DEV
#=SIT=Hello from SIT
#=UAT=Hello from UAT
#=QA=sHello from QA
#=PROD=Hello from PROD
#
#
# Command to be excecuted matching the environment tag passed on the command line
#
#    A tag descriptor is one or more strings prefixed with a '#' and then
#    SURROUNDED with ':' that will be matched against the value specified
#    against the environment tag (case insensitive).
#
#    Notes:
#       Do NOT leave whitespace between the first '#' and the ':'
#       Do NOT leave whitespace inside the ':'
#
#
#   Sample tag descriptors:-
#
#   :+:         select regardless of value of st.env
#   :-:         deselect regardless of value of st.env (disabled)
#   :sss:       select only if exact match of sss to value of st.env
#   :+sss:      same as above.
#   :aaa:bbb:   select only if exact match of aaa or bbb to value of st.env
#   :-sss:      deselect only if exact match of sss to the value of st.env, else selected
#   :-aaa:-bbb: deselect if aaa or bbb are exact matches to the value of st.env, else selected
#   :-aaa:bbb:  deselect only if exact match of -aaa to the value of st.env, else selected (bbb ignored)
#
#   Example lines :-
#
#:+:             echo "One"
#:-:             echo "Two"
#:DEV:           echo "Three"
#:-PROD:         echo "Four"
#:DEV:UAT:       echo "Five"
#:-SIT:-UAT:     echo "Six"
#:qa:            echo "Seven"
#
# Given that the value of the environment tag=DEV,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Three Four Five Six
#
#
# Given that the value of the environment tag=SIT,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four
#
#
# Given that the value of the environment tag=UAT,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Five
#
#
# Given that the value of the environment tag=PROD,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Six
#
#
# Given that the value of the environment tag=QA,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Six
