# ShellScriptListProcessor configuration file
#
# The format of this file is :-
#
#    Lines starting with a '#' may be a comment, or a line to be evaluated as
#    either a environment value value to be set (st.value) or whitespace
#    followed by a command line to execute (to end of line)
#
#    To be safe, for comments use '# ' or '##' as the line prefix.
#
#    Do note that the tag descriptors are case insensitive in regard to matching
#    against the environment tag.
#
##############################################################
# Global settings
#
# '#@' prefix
#
# TIMEOUT_SECONDS - How many seconds that the entire set of commands can take before
#                   the framework will terminate any ones still running.
# THREAD_POOL     - How many commands can be run in parallel.
#
#@TIMEOUT_SECONDS@60
#@THREAD_POOL_SIZE@2

# There are three environmental variables set automatically :-
#
# ST_TAG    The tag selector as passed on the command line.
# ST_LINE   The specific line number from this file when a command is executing.
# ST_OS     The operating system currently running on (windows|unix), this also
#           determines the shell used to run the commands.
#
#           cmd /c for windows
#           bash -c for unix
#
#
# If any of the environmental variable names clash with existing ones, they will NOT be set
# but then the prefix (ST_) can be changed by setting a system property (-Dst.env.name.prefix=)
#
#
# '#=' prefix
#
# There is a 4th environmental variable that can be set (ST_VALUE) based on the relevant
# matching tag selector from the command line so it can be used further down in this file.
#
# E.g. if the tag selector specified was 'UAT' then the contents of the
# ST_VALUE environmental variable would contain 'Hello from UAT'.
#
#=DEV=Hello from DEV
#=SIT=Hello from SIT
#=UAT=Hello from UAT
#=QA=sHello from QA
#=PROD=Hello from PROD

##############################################################
# Command to be executed matching the selector tag passed on the command line
#
# '#:' prefix
#
# A tag descriptor is one or more strings prefixed with a '#' and then
# SURROUNDED with ':' that will be matched against the value specified
# against the environment tag (case insensitive).
#
# Notes:
#    Do NOT leave whitespace between the first '#' and the ':'
#    Do NOT leave whitespace inside the ':'
#
#
# Sample tag descriptors:-
#
#   :+:         select regardless of value of selector tag
#   :-:         deselect regardless of value of the selector tag (disabled)
#   :sss:       select only if exact match of sss to value of the selector tag
#   :+sss:      same as above.
#   :aaa:bbb:   select only if exact match of aaa or bbb to value of the selector tag
#   :-sss:      deselect only if exact match of sss to the value of the selector tag, else selected
#   :-aaa:-bbb: deselect if aaa or bbb are exact matches to the value of the selector tag, else selected
#   :-aaa:bbb:  deselect only if exact match of -aaa to the value of the selector tag, else selected (bbb ignored)
#
# Example lines :-
#
#:+:             echo "One"
#:-:             echo "Two"
#:DEV:           echo "Three"
#:-PROD:         echo "Four"
#:DEV:UAT:       echo "Five"
#:-SIT:-UAT:     echo "Six"
#:qa:            echo "Seven"
#
# Given that the value of the tag=DEV,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Three Four Five Six
#
#
# Given that the value of the selector tag 'SIT',
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four
#
#
# Given that the value of the selector tag 'UAT',
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Five
#
#
# Given that the value of the selector tag 'PROD',
#
#   We will get the outputs One Six
#
#
# Given that the value of the selector tag 'QA',
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Six
