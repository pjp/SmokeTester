#    When the ShellScriptListProcessor is executed, two System variables should be set
#    on the command line (st.env & st.dev) to specify the logical environment to run against
#    and a general purpose value for use in that environment. Both of these variables are
#    exposed as environment variables with the same names and values.
#
#    e.g.
#       -Dst.env=DEV -Dst.value=blah
#
# The format of this file is :-
#
#    Lines starting with a '#' may be a comment or a line to be executed
#    that starts with '#' then followed by a tag descriptor, then whitespace
#    followed by a command line to execute (to end of line)
#
#    A tag descriptor is one or more strings prefixed with a '#' and then
#    SURROUNDED with ':' that will be matched against the value specified
#    for st.env (case insensitive).
#
#    Notes:
#       Do NOT leave whitespace between the first '#' and the ':'
#       Do NOT leave whitespace inside the ':'
#       Do note that the tag descriptors are case insensitive in regard to matching
#          against the value of st.env

#   Sample tag descriptors:-
#
#   :+:         select regardless of value of st.env
#   :-:         deselect regardless of value of st.env (disabled)
#   :sss:       select only if exact match of sss to value of st.env
#   :+sss:      same as above.
#   :aaa:bbb:   select only if exact match of aaa or bbb to value of st.env
#   :-sss:      deselect only if exact match of sss to the value of st.env, else selected
#   :-aaa:-bbb: deselect if aaa or bbb are exact matches to the value of st.env, else selected
#   :-aaa:bbb:  deselect only if exact match of -aaa to the value of st.env, else selected (bbb ignored)
#
#   Example lines :-
#
#:+:             echo "One"
#:-:             echo "Two"
#:DEV:           echo "Three"
#:-PROD:         echo "Four"
#:DEV:UAT:       echo "Five"
#:-SIT:-UAT:     echo "Six"
#:qa:            echo "Seven"
#
# Given that the value of st.env=DEV,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Three Four Five Six
#
#
# Given that the value of st.env=SIT,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four
#
#
# Given that the value of st.env=UAT,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Five
#
#
# Given that the value of st.env=PROD,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Six
#
#
# Given that the value of st.env=QA,
#
#   We will get the outputs One Four Six

# Note that for environmental variable expansion directly on the command line
# a shell has to be specified. If the command is a shell script, then the
# environmental variables will be available as normal to it as usual.
#
# This command should run in ALL environments
#:+:   cmd /c echo hello world %st.env% = %st.value%

# This command should only run in DEV
